        "Based on a sample of 25 restaurants with a mean weekly operating cost of Rs. 3,050, compared to the cost model’s predicted mean of Rs. 4,000, a t-test statistic of –38.0 was calculated.\n",
        "Since the absolute value of the test statistic (|–38.0| = 38.0) is greater than the critical value (±1.96 at a 5% significance level), the null hypothesis is rejected.\n",
        "This indicates that there is a statistically significant difference between the sample mean and the model’s predicted mean.\n",
        "However, because the sample mean is lower than the model’s mean, the results contradict the restaurant owners’ claim that operating costs are higher than predicted.\n",
        "Instead, the data suggests that actual weekly operating costs are significantly lower than the model’s estimation."
